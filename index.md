### Dissociable patterns of rich and diverse club development in youth

*The human brain can be analyzed as a network—a collection of interconnected regions. Each brain region has a unique connectivity pattern. The set of regions called the rich club have many strong connections. The diverse club has connections spread diversely across the brain’s various sub-networks; this diversity is measured by the participation coefficient. The rich and diverse clubs are named as such because members are strongly interconnected. Here, we examined how the interconnectedness of these clubs, defined in adults, evolved over age and related to executive function in youth.*
